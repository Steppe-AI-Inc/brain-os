# Known Failure Modes

Every entry is a real, reproduced defect (not a theoretical risk) with root cause and
fix status. Update this file whenever a new bug class is found — per CLAUDE.md §12,
finding one instance of a pattern means searching for the whole class before closing it.

## 10. `/chat` composer unusable on mobile by default (OPEN — not fixed this pass)

**Found while:** live mobile testing (acceptance test #17) against real production at
~500px viewport width.

**Symptom, reproduced live and confirmed via zoomed screenshot:** the message input on
the "Speak with Brain OS" page — the app's core interaction — collapses to roughly 30px
wide, rendering its own placeholder text one character per line. Confirmed this isn't a
one-off render glitch: it's consistent, and collapsing the page's channel-thread sidebar
(a manual toggle that exists on the page) immediately fixes it, which pinpoints the cause.

**Root cause:** `web/app/(app)/chat/chat-client.tsx:440` lays out the channel-thread
`ChannelSidebar` and the main chat column in one `flex` row
(`<div className="flex flex-1 gap-4 overflow-hidden">`) with no responsive
breakpoint to stack or hide the thread sidebar at narrow widths — unlike the app-wide
navigation sidebar (`app-sidebar.tsx`), which already has a proper mobile drawer
(fixed in an earlier session, commit `e6346e0`). The manual collapse toggle on
`ChannelSidebar` is a real workaround, but nothing collapses it automatically for a
narrow viewport, so a first-time mobile visitor lands on a broken composer by default.

**Fix:** not done this pass — flagged for the founder rather than pushed live
unsupervised, consistent with this session's approach to any production-facing change
found late in a sweep. The fix shape is straightforward (default `collapsed` to `true`
below a width threshold, or switch the outer container to stack vertically on small
screens the same way the main sidebar does) but wasn't written speculatively without
being able to verify it live end-to-end in the remaining session time.

**Search performed for the same class:** did not yet check every other page for the same
"two fixed-width flex siblings, no mobile breakpoint" pattern — only `/chat` was
exercised live at mobile width this pass. Flagged as the next step before this failure
class can be closed with confidence.

## 1. Legacy write-bypass RLS policies (FIXED, 2026-08-26)

**Symptom:** none visible from the UI — this was found by systematically auditing every
`cmd='ALL'` policy in `pg_policies`, not from a bug report.

**Root cause:** five tables (`proposals`, `proposal_items`, `product_lines`,
`inventory_items`, `sales_leads`) each carried an old `*_company_scope` policy
(`cmd=ALL`, `qual=has_company_access(company_id)`) left over from before proper
`*_write_manager` / granular insert-update-delete policies were introduced. Since RLS
policies are PERMISSIVE (OR'd together), the old broad policy silently coexisted with
the new narrow one — any active company member, not just managers, could
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE these rows.

**Fix:** dropped the five legacy policies (migration `202608260020`). Verified via a
real impersonation test (a non-manager test account's `INSERT` into `proposals` was
rejected with `42501` after the fix).

**Search performed for the same class:** queried every `cmd='ALL'` policy in the schema
(21 total) and manually reviewed each `qual`. Only these five had a redundant broader
sibling. No further instances found as of this writing.

## 2. Storage sensitivity not enforced (FIXED, 2026-08-26)

**Root cause:** `documents_bucket_select` (Storage RLS on the `documents` bucket)
checked only company-folder membership (`has_company_access`), never
`documents.sensitivity`. A confidential document's *row* could be correctly blocked
while its *file bytes* remained fetchable via a signed URL, because Storage RLS never
joined back to the owning document's sensitivity tier.

**Fix:** rewrote the Storage SELECT policy to join `storage.objects.name` to
`documents.storage_path` and gate by the same sensitivity tiers the table uses
(migration `202608260021`/`202608260022`).

## 3. Edge Function deployment has no CI/CD (PARTIALLY FIXED — still blocked on a founder action)

**Symptom:** `.github/workflows/supabase-functions.yml` referenced Supabase project ref
`gyqlkgnyyzpwaswhshlw` — different from production's `pvphxgrtdfrudejjhzjk` — and
triggered on `branches: [main]`, a branch that doesn't exist on `origin` (default is
`master`). Zero runs, ever, in the repo's history; not even registered in GitHub's
workflow list.

**Root cause (both bugs, confirmed):** (1) wrong branch name in the push trigger — this
alone means the workflow could never fire from a normal push, regardless of the project
ref; (2) wrong project ref, so even a `workflow_dispatch` manual run would have deployed
to the wrong Supabase project.

**Fixed 2026-08-27:** corrected both — branch to `master`, project ref to
`pvphxgrtdfrudejjhzjk`, and broadened it to deploy all functions in
`supabase/functions/` (not just `sem-ai-command`) since all 6 are real production
dependencies now. Confirmed the workflow is now registered and `active` in GitHub's
workflow list (`gh api repos/.../actions/workflows`) — it wasn't a YAML parse issue,
GitHub just hadn't processed a push containing this file before.

**Still blocked:** `gh secret list` returns zero configured secrets for this repo.
`SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` doesn't exist, so the workflow will now run but fail at the
deploy step with an auth error. Generating and adding that secret is a founder action
(Supabase account token generation + GitHub repo secret) — not something to provision
unsupervised. **BLOCKER for founder:** add `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` at Settings →
Secrets and variables → Actions, generated from
https://supabase.com/dashboard/account/tokens.

**Until then:** manual deploy + `supabase functions download` + `git diff` verification
(REGRESSION_CATALOG.md) remains the only real safety net — same as before this fix, just
now the automated path is one secret away from working instead of two bugs plus a
secret away.

## 4. AI context presented truncated arrays as complete totals (FIXED, 2026-08-27)

**Symptom (real production example):** founder asked Brain OS chat how many pending
approvals existed; it said "20" (the `.limit(20)` cap on `context.approvals`) when the
real total was 75.

**Root cause:** `sem-ai-command`'s `buildContext()` fetches `context.tasks` capped at
`.limit(30)` and `context.approvals` capped at `.limit(20)`, with no signal in the
payload that these are partial. The model had no way to distinguish "the whole
approvals list" from "the first 20 approvals" and inferred a false total from array
length — plausible LLM behavior given the data shape, not a hallucination.

**Fix:** added real `COUNT` queries (`{count:'exact', head:true}`, same RLS as the row
queries) for tasks/approvals/companies/people/projects/goals/sales_leads/inventory as
`context.counts`, and required the prompt to use them for any "how many" question,
stating "X of Y shown" when truncated. Verified live: asked the exact question again
post-fix, got "67 pending approvals... 20 of 67 approvals... shown" — cross-checked
against direct `SELECT COUNT(*)` and it matched exactly (67/67, 61/61).

**Search performed for the same class:** checked `web/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx`'s
stat counters (the other executive-summary surface) — all already use real `COUNT`
queries, no truncation-as-total issue there. Checked all 12 files under
`web/lib/data/` using `.limit()` — the rest are ordinary UI list pagination (a
"recent N" widget, never presented as "the total"), not the same bug class.

## 5. Duplicate clarification/blocker tasks for repeated ambiguous requests (FIXED, 2026-08-27)

**Symptom:** the founder said variations of "delete channels" / "clear chat" across
roughly 10 hours (multiple separate sessions); Brain OS created **9 separate
near-duplicate** "URGENT/CRITICAL: confirm scope" tasks (and 9 matching pending
approvals) instead of recognizing the repeated question.

**Root cause:** `sem-ai-command`'s system prompt explicitly instructs the model to
check `context.companies`/`context.people`/`context.projects`/`context.goals`/
`context.companyRelationships`/`context.personAssignments` before creating a duplicate
— but had **no equivalent instruction for ordinary tasks**, even though `context.tasks`
already includes existing open clarification tasks the model could have checked
against.

**Fix:** added an explicit "check context.tasks for an existing equivalent request
before creating a new task" rule to the prompt, called out clarification/blocker tasks
by name as the primary case this affects.

**Cleanup:** consolidated the 9 existing duplicates — marked `done` (tasks) /
`cancelled` (approvals) with a resolution note explaining why, not deleted (audit trail
preserved per CLAUDE.md's "never silently create fake production work" / preserve
audit principle applied in reverse — don't silently erase real audit history either).

**Not yet done:** this fix is prompt-level (LLM judgment), which is appropriate for a
fuzzy "is this the same question" decision but isn't a hard guarantee the way a
database constraint would be. A deterministic secondary guard (e.g. reject an insert if
an open task with the exact same title already exists for the same company) was
considered but not implemented — flagged as a possible future hardening, not required
given task titles vary in wording turn to turn (an exact-title check would have caught
0 of these 9 duplicates, since the model varied the wording each time).

## 6. Undocumented (previously untracked) deployed Edge Function (FIXED, 2026-08-27)

See LIVE_SYSTEM_MAP.md "Resolved this pass" — `sem-artifact-analyze` was live in
production with no corresponding file anywhere in git history. Recovered and committed.
Search performed: all 6 deployed functions cross-checked against `supabase functions
list`; no other undocumented functions found.

## 8. Production approvals_update_approver policy has NO domain gating — any company manager can approve finance/salary/legal (FIXED and VERIFIED LIVE, 2026-08-27)

**Found while:** testing acceptance test #6 ("unauthorized manager cannot approve
finance/salary/legal") via real live impersonation, per CLAUDE.md's "test the actual
write-action RLS, not just read visibility."

**Symptom, reproduced live:** a real, temporary `company_memberships` row was created for
the standing test account (`profile_id='66ef2052-d002-4592-b841-82cd2171b51a'`,
`profiles.role='employee'` — NOT founder/holding_admin/hr_finance) as `role_in_company =
'manager'` at SEM Technologies LLC. Four real temporary `approvals` rows were created,
one per domain: `finance`, `salary_hr`, `production`, `legal`, all `status='pending'`.
Impersonating that account, `UPDATE approvals SET status='approved' WHERE id=...` was run
against each row. **All four succeeded** — finance and salary_hr and legal, not just
production. All test rows were then deleted (see git-tracked commit for this entry).

**Root cause, confirmed via `pg_policy`/`pg_get_expr` against the live linked project (not
inferred from any file):** production's actual `approvals_update_approver` policy reads
```
(is_founder_or_admin() OR (approver_profile_id = current_profile_id()) OR is_company_manager(company_id))
```
— the original v0.7 baseline from `202606190001_sem_brain_v071_production_core.sql`, with
**no domain gating at all**. But migration `202608230001_security_hardening_rls.sql`
(already in this repo's tracked history, already merged to `master`) rewrites this exact
policy to require `is_hr_finance()` for `finance`/`salary_hr` and restricts `legal` to
founder/admin/explicit-approver only — and Supabase's own migration history
(`supabase migration list --linked`) reports `202608230001` as **applied** to this
project. The live policy content does not match what that migration (or the tracked
`schema-v0.7-production-core.sql`) says it should be. This is GitHub↔production drift of
exactly the kind CLAUDE.md §2 exists to catch — the migration ledger says one thing, the
live database says another. Cause of the drift itself (an out-of-band manual policy edit
after the migration ran, vs. the migration silently no-opping) was not chased further
since the remediation is identical either way — see "Search performed" below for why this
wasn't assumed to be an isolated one-off.

**Real-world impact:** any `company_manager`/`owner`/`team_lead`-tier person (not just
founder or an `hr_finance`-tier profile) can currently approve or reject **any** pending
approval in their company via a direct PostgREST `PATCH` to `/approvals`, including salary
decisions, financial approvals, and legal approvals — bypassing the entire point of
domain-gated approval routing. This is a live, real security gap, not a theoretical one.

**Fix applied and verified live in production, 2026-08-27:** migration
`supabase/migrations/202608270001_restore_approvals_domain_gating.sql` re-applies the
correct domain-gated policy (idempotent `drop policy if exists` + `create policy`,
identical to `202608230001`'s version). The initial `supabase db push --linked` was
blocked by this session's own auto-mode safety classifier as a live production
security change, correctly — that block was not routed around. **The founder
subsequently authorized the push explicitly** ("push the approvals fix"), and it was
applied. Re-verified with the exact same live impersonation methodology used to find
the bug (not just re-reading the policy text or trusting `supabase migration list`,
given that's precisely what was misleading the first time): a fresh temporary
company-manager test account attempted to approve four new temporary test approvals,
one per domain. Result — `finance`: stayed `pending` (blocked, correct); `salary_hr`:
stayed `pending` (blocked, correct); `legal`: stayed `pending` (blocked, correct);
`production`: became `approved` (allowed, correct). All test rows and the temporary
membership deleted after. Live `pg_get_expr` on `approvals_update_approver` now matches
the migration exactly.

**Search performed for the same drift class:** compared every other policy on
`public.approvals` (`approvals_select_scope`, `approvals_insert_scope`) — both match their
tracked source exactly, live `pg_get_expr` output word-for-word identical to
`schema-v0.7-production-core.sql`. Then went further and dumped **all 108** live `public`
schema policies (`pg_policy` + `pg_get_expr`, every table) and diffed policy-name-by-table
against all 95 `create policy` statements in `schema-v0.7-production-core.sql`. Result:
`approvals_update_approver` is the **only** policy whose live expression text differs from
its tracked source — every other shared policy matched word-for-word. The diff did surface
a second, different-shaped issue (13 live policies with no tracked source at all, on 3
undocumented tables) — see #9. Not yet done: the same diff for `storage.objects` and any
non-`public`-schema policies.

## 9. Undocumented Kanban tables (boards/board_columns/board_items) live in production with zero tracked source (FIXED — recovered into git, 2026-08-27)

**Found while:** the broader policy-drift sweep for #8 (diffing all live `public` policies
against `schema-v0.7-production-core.sql`).

**Symptom:** 13 live policies (4 on `boards`, 4 on `board_columns`, 4 on `board_items`,
covering select/insert/update/delete) exist in production with no corresponding
`create policy` anywhere in the schema file, and no migration file in
`supabase/migrations/` mentions these table names at all. A `SECURITY DEFINER` function,
`can_manage_board_item(board_id, task_id)`, also exists undocumented. This is the same
failure class as #6 (`sem-artifact-analyze`) — a feature built directly against
production (likely a Kanban-board prototype) that never had its schema committed.

**Verified NOT an active risk before recovering it:** `relrowsecurity=true` on all three
tables (RLS is actually enforced, not silently open), all three have **0 rows** in
production, and `grep`ing `web/` found no reference to `boards`/`board_columns`/
`board_items` outside the auto-generated `web/types/database.ts` — no shipped UI path
reads or writes this feature, so nothing is currently exposed through the app.
`can_manage_board_item`'s logic was read in full: gated correctly by
founder/company-manager/task-owner, no bypass found.

**Fix:** recovered full DDL (columns, constraints, RLS policies, the function) via direct
introspection (`information_schema.columns`, `pg_constraint`, `pg_get_functiondef`) into
`supabase/migrations/202608270002_recover_boards_kanban_tables.sql` — every statement is
idempotent (`create table if not exists`, `drop policy if exists` + recreate), so applying
it against production is a verified no-op, not a live change. This migration was NOT
pushed this pass (bundled with the #8 fix, both awaiting the founder's one-time `db push`
authorization) but poses zero risk either way since it only re-describes what's already
live.

## 7. company_id never populated on audit_logs/work_orders/chat_channels (OPEN — functional gap, not a leak)

**Found while:** closing out SECURITY_MATRIX.md's impersonation-testing gap for these
three tables.

**Symptom:** `company_id IS NULL` on 100% of real rows — 141/141 `audit_logs`, 99/99
`work_orders`, 3/3 `chat_channels`. The `is_company_manager(company_id)` RLS branch
added in migration `202608260024` is therefore inert in current practice: real access
to these tables is entirely governed by `is_founder_or_admin() OR actor/creator = self`.

**Verified this is NOT a leak:** a non-manager test account's visible rows matched its
own actor/creator rows exactly (4/4 `audit_logs`, 6/6 `work_orders`, 0/0
`chat_channels`) — precise match, not "fewer than everything."

**Real consequence:** a company_manager who is not the founder currently cannot see any
audit trail, work order, or chat history for their own company, because nothing ever
sets `company_id` on these rows at creation time. The "manager reviews their team's
activity" capability implied by the RLS design doesn't actually work — not because the
policy is wrong, but because the data feeding it is incomplete.

**Fix:** not done this pass. Would need `company_id` set at creation time in
`sem-ai-command` (for `work_orders`/`chat_channels`, from context when the command is
clearly about one company) and wherever `audit_logs` rows get inserted. Lower priority
than the leaks fixed tonight since it's over-restrictive (blocks legitimate access)
rather than under-restrictive (leaks data), but worth fixing before a real
company_manager persona is onboarded and expects to use this.

## 11. `memories` sensitivity is model-assigned with no floor against source data (OPEN — real gap, found while writing governance docs 2026-08-27)

**Found while:** writing `governance/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md` invariant #7
("AI-generated summaries inherit the highest sensitivity of their source information")
— checking whether this held true against the actual `sem_execute_ai_command` RPC found
that it doesn't, structurally.

**Root cause:** the RPC inserts a `memories` row with
`coalesce((v_memory->>'sensitivity')::visibility_level, 'internal'::visibility_level)` —
the sensitivity tier is whatever the model itself decided to output (or `internal` if it
said nothing), with **no validation against what the memory's `fact` text was actually
derived from**. `memories_select_scope` then honors that tier normally
(`sensitivity in ('public','internal')` → any company member; `confidential` → manager+/
hr_finance).

**Concrete failure scenario:** the founder (who has real access to `financial_reports`)
asks Brain OS chat "summarize how CLIX GPS is doing financially." If the model writes
the resulting summary as a `memories` row tagged `internal` (the default if it doesn't
think to tag it `confidential`), that memory — containing real revenue/cash figures —
becomes readable by any active member of CLIX GPS via the normal RAG/memory pipeline,
even though `financial_reports` itself remains correctly locked to manager+/hr_finance.
This is a real leak path through a side door, not through the table the data actually
lives in.

**Status:** not reproduced live this pass (would require actually prompting the model
and inspecting the resulting `memories.sensitivity` value across several real
financial/salary-adjacent questions) and not fixed — found via code/architecture review
while writing `governance/SECURITY_INVARIANTS.md`, flagged here per this file's own
"write it down even when found outside a live test" standard. Two possible fixes, either
is legitimate, founder's call: (a) have the RPC compute a floor for `sensitivity` based
on which source tables/fields the memory candidate's context was drawn from, or (b)
require the same authorization as the source data to even create a memory referencing
it (e.g. only manager+/hr_finance-tier callers can create memories tagged `internal` or
lower that touch financial/salary facts). **Recommend live-reproducing this before
fixing** — per this project's own "no fake verification" standard, confirm the actual
failure (ask the real chat a real financial question, inspect the resulting
`memories.sensitivity` value directly via SQL) before writing a fix for it.

## 12. `hr_finance` role has zero access to `financial_reports` (FIX WRITTEN, PENDING PRODUCTION PUSH, 2026-08-27)

**Found while:** persona-matrix testing (`qa/SECURITY_MATRIX.md`) — live impersonation
of an `hr_finance`-tier account with no company memberships.

**Symptom, reproduced live:** the test account correctly saw all `finance`/`salary_hr`
domain approvals (21/21) and all `salary_rules` (3/3), but **0 of 2 real
`financial_reports` rows** — despite `financial_reports` being exactly the kind of
company financial data an HR/Finance role would be expected to review, and despite
every *other* finance-adjacent table (`salary_private`, `salary_rules`, `kpi_records`)
already including `is_hr_finance()` in its policy.

**Root cause:** `financial_reports_select_scope`/`_write_scope` were
`is_founder_or_admin() OR is_company_manager(company_id)` — never called
`is_hr_finance()` at all. Inconsistent with the pattern every sibling table already
uses.

**Fix written:** `supabase/migrations/202608270003_financial_reports_hr_finance_access.sql`
adds `is_hr_finance()` to both policies, matching the established pattern.
`schema-v0.7-production-core.sql` updated to match. `supabase db push --linked --dry-run`
confirms it's the only pending migration and applies cleanly.

**NOT yet applied to production** — the push was blocked by this session's own
auto-mode safety classifier as a live security-policy change (same class of block the
`approvals_update_approver` fix hit before the founder explicitly authorized that one).
Per this session's operating rules, not routed around. **Needs the founder to run
`supabase db push --linked` or explicitly authorize it**, then re-verify live (same
method as #8: temporary hr_finance-tier test account, confirm it now sees the real
`financial_reports` count, clean up after).
